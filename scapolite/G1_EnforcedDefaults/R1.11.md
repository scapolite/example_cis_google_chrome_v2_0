## /rule

(L1) Ensure 'Whether online OCSP/CRL checks are performed' is set to
'Disabled'

## /rationale

An attacker may block OCSP traffic and cause revocation checks to pass
in order to cause usage of soft-fail behavior. Furthermore, the browser
may leak what website is being accessed and who accesses it to CA
servers.

## /description

Google Chrome offers to reactivate soft-fail, online revocation checks
although they provide no effective security benefit.

## /implementations/0/description

To establish the recommended configuration via Group Policy, set the
following UI path to `Disabled`:

`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Google\Google Chrome\Whether online OCSP/CRL checks are performed`

Impact:

If this setting is disabled, unsecure online OCSP/CRL checks are no
longer performed.
