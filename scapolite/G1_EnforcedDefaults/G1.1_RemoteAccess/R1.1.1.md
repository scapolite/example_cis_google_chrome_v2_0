## /rule

(L1) Ensure 'Enable curtaining of remote access hosts' is set to
'Disabled'

## /rationale

If a remote session is in progress the user physically present at the
host machine shall be able to see what a remote user is doing.

## /description

Chrome allows controls to prevent someone physically present at the host
machine from seeing what a user is doing while a remote connection is in
progress.

## /implementations/0/description

To establish the recommended configuration via Group Policy, set the
following UI path to `Disabled`.

`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Google\Google Chrome\Configure remote access options\Enable curtaining of remote access hosts `

Impact:

If this setting is disabled, host's physical input and output devices
are enabled while a remote connection is in progress.
