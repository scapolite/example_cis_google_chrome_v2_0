## /rule

(L1) Ensure 'Allow remote users to interact with elevated windows in
remote assistance sessions' is set to 'Disabled'

## /rationale

Remote users shall not be able to escalate privileges.

## /description

Google Chrome offers to run the remote assistance host in a process with
uiAccess permissions. This allows remote users to interact with elevated
windows on the local user's desktop.

## /implementations/0/description

To establish the recommended configuration via Group Policy, set the
following UI path to `Disabled`.

`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Google\Google Chrome\Configure remote access options\Allow remote users to interact with elevated windows in remote assistance sessions`

Impact:

If this setting is disabled, the remote assistance host will run in the
user's context. Furthermore, remote users cannot interact with elevated
windows on the desktop.
