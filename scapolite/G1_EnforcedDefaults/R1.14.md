## /rule

(L1) Ensure 'Origins or hostname patterns for which restrictions on
insecure origins should not apply' is set to 'Disabled'

## /rationale

Insecure contexts shall always be labeled as insecure.

## /description

Google Chrome allows to specify a list of origins (URLs) or hostname
patterns (such as "\*.example.com") for which security restrictions on
insecure origins will not apply and are prevented from being labeled as
"Not Secure" in the omnibox.

## /implementations/0/description

To establish the recommended configuration via Group Policy, set the
following UI path to `Disabled`:

`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Google\Google Chrome\Origins or hostname patterns for which restrictions on insecure origins should not apply`

Impact:

Insecure contexts are labeled as insecure.
