## /rule

(L1) Ensure 'Disable Certificate Transparency enforcement for a list of
URLs' is set to 'Disabled'

## /rationale

Certificates that are required to be disclosed via Certificate
Transparency shall be treated for all URLs as untrusted if they are not
disclosed according to the Certificate Transparency policy.

## /description

Google Chrome allows to specify URLs/hostnames for which Certificate
Transparency will not be enforced.

## /implementations/0/description

To establish the recommended configuration via Group Policy, set the
following UI path to `Disabled`:

`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Google\Google Chrome\Disable Certificate Transparency enforcement for a list of URLs`

Impact:

If this setting is disabled, no URLs are excluded from Certificate
Transparency requirements.
