## /rule

(L1) Ensure 'Enable HTTP/0.9 support on non-default ports' is set to
'Disabled'

## /rationale

DNS rebinding attacks can be mounted against non-HTTP services to steal
their responses cross-protocol.

## /description

Non-HTTP services' responses may be read via XHR as their response
streams will be interpreted by Chrome as HTTP/0.9. This setting allows
to enable HTTP/0.9 on ports other than 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS.

## /implementations/0/description

To establish the recommended configuration via Group Policy, set the
following UI path to `Disabled`:

`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Google\Google Chrome\Enable HTTP/0.9 support on non-default ports`

Impact:

If this setting is disabled, HTTP/0.9 will be disabled on non-default
ports 80/443.
