## /rule

(L1) Ensure 'Continue running background apps when Google Chrome is
closed' is set to 'Disabled'

## /rationale

If this setting is enabled, vulnerable or malicious plugins, apps and
processes can continue running even after Chrome has closed.

## /description

Chrome allows for processes started while the browser is open to remain
running once the browser has been closed. It also allows for background
apps and the current browsing session to remain active after the browser
has been closed.

## /implementations/0/description

To establish the recommended configuration via Group Policy, set the
following UI path to `Disabled`.

`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Google\Google Chrome\Continue running background apps when Google Chrome is closed`

Impact:

If this policy is set to Disabled, background mode is disabled and
cannot be controlled by the user in the browser settings.
