## /rule

(L2) Ensure 'Configure native messaging blacklist' is set to
'Enabled' ("\*" for all messaging applications)

## /rationale

For consistency with Plugin and Extension policies, native messaging
should be blacklisted by default, requiring explicit administrative
approval of applications for whitelisting. Examples of applications that
use native messaging is the 1Password password manager.

## /description

Allows you to specify which native messaging hosts that should not be
loaded.

Note: This needs to be handled carefully. If an extension is enabled,
yet can't communicate with its backend code, it could behave in strange
ways which results in helpdesk tickets + support load.

## /implementations/0/description

To establish the recommended configuration via Group Policy, set the
following UI path to `Enabled` with value `*` specified.

`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Google\Google Chrome\Native Messaging\Configure native messaging blacklist`

Impact:

A blacklist value of '\*' means all native messaging hosts are
blacklisted unless they are explicitly listed in the whitelist.
