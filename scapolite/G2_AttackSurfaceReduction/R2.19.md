## /rule

(L1) Ensure 'Enable Chrome Cleanup on Windows' is Configured

## /rationale

The Google Chrome Cleanup is ON by default and each organization should
review and determine if they want to use this solutions for malware
detection. If another solution is used instead of the built in Chrome
option then an organization should configure the setting to Disabled.

## /description

Chrome provides a Cleanup-feature to detect unwanted software. This
feature periodically scans the system for unwanted software and will ask
the user if they wish to remove it, if any been found.

## /implementations/0/description

To establish the recommended configuration via Group Policy, configure
the following setting to meet organizational requirements:

`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Google\Google Chrome\Enable Chrome Cleanup on Windows`

Impact:

if Disabled, Chrome Cleanup will no longer be able to scan the system.
If users do not have a centrally managed anti-malware solution then
leaving this setting enabled can help protect a system.
