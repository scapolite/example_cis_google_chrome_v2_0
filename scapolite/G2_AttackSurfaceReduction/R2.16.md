## /rule

(L1) Ensure 'Notify a user that a browser relaunch or device restart is
recommended or required' is set to 'Enabled' with 'Show a recurring
prompt to the user indication that a relaunch is required' specified

## /rationale

Security Updates shall be installed as soon as possible after release.

## /description

Google Chrome offers to notify users that Google Chrome must be
restarted to apply a pending update once the notification period defined
by policy 'Set the time period for update notifications' is passed.

## /implementations/0/description

To establish the recommended configuration via Group Policy, set the
following UI path to `Enabled` with value
`Show a recurring prompt to the user indication that a relaunch is required`
specified:

`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Google\Google Chrome\Notify a user that a browser relaunch or device restart is recommended or required`

Impact:

A recurring warning will be shown to the user indicating that a browser
relaunch will be forced once the notification period passes. The user's
session is restored after the relaunch of Google Chrome.
