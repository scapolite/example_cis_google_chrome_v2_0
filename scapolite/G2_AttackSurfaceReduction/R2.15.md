## /rule

(L1) Ensure 'Disable proceeding from the Safe Browsing warning page'
is set to 'Enabled'

## /rationale

Malicious web pages are widely spread in the internet and pose the most
significant threat to the user today. Users shall be prevented from
navigating to potentially malicious web content.

## /description

Google provides the Safe Browsing service. It shows a warning page when
users navigate to sites that are flagged as potentially malicious.

## /implementations/0/description

To establish the recommended configuration via Group Policy, set the
following UI path to `Enabled`:

`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Google\Google Chrome\Disable proceeding from the Safe Browsing warning page`

Impact:

Enabling this setting prevents users from proceeding anyway from the
warning page to the malicious site. In some cases legitimate sites could
be blocked and users would be prevented from accessing.
