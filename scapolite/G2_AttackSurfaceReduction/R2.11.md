## /rule

(L1) Ensure 'Allow running plugins that are outdated' is set to
'Disabled'

## /rationale

Running the most up-to-date version of a plugin can reduce the
possibility of running a plugin that contains an exploit or security
hole.

## /description

Chrome enables the use of outdated plugins. By disabling this feature
Chrome will not prompt the user to use an outdated plugin.

## /implementations/0/description

To establish the recommended configuration via Group Policy, set the
following UI path to `Disabled`.

`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Google\Google Chrome\Allow running plugins that are outdated`

Impact:

If you disable this setting, outdated plugins will not be used and users
will not be asked for permission to run them.
