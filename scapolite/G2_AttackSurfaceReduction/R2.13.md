## /rule

(L1) Ensure 'Enable Site Isolation for every site' is set to
'Enabled'

## /rationale

Chrome will load each website in its own process. So, even if a site
bypasses the same-origin policy, the extra security will help stop the
site from stealing your data from another website.

## /description

This policy controls is every website will load into its own process.

## /implementations/0/description

To establish the recommended configuration via Group Policy, set the
following UI path to `Enabled`.

`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Google\Google Chrome\Enable Site Isolation for every site`

Impact:

If the policy is enabled, each site will run in its own process which
will cause the system to use more memory. You might want to look at the
IsolateOrigins policy setting to get the best of both worlds, isolation
and limited impact for users, by using IsolateOrigins with a list of the
sites you want to isolate.
