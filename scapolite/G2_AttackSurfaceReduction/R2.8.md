## /rule

(L1) Ensure 'Enable saving passwords to the password manager' is
Configured

## /rationale

The Google Chrome password manager is ON by default and each
organization should review and determine if they want to allow users to
store passwords in the Browser. If another solution is used instead of
the built in Chrome option then an organization should configure the
setting to Disabled.

## /description

Google Chrome has a built in password manager to store passwords for
users. Chrome will use local authentication to allow users to gain
access to these passwords.

NOTE: If you choose to Enable this setting please review
`Disable synchronization of data with Google` and ensure this setting is
configured to meet organizational requirements.

## /implementations/0/description

To establish the recommended configuration via Group Policy, configure
the following setting to meet organizational requirements:

`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Google\Google Chrome\Password manager\Enable the password manager`

Impact:

If this settings is disabled, users cannot save new passwords but they
may still use passwords that have been saved previously.

If this settings is enabled or not configured, users can save passwords.
