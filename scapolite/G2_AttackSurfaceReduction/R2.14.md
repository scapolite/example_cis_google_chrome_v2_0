## /rule

(L1) Ensure 'Allow download restrictions' is set to 'Enabled' with
'Block dangerous downloads' specified.

## /rationale

Users shall be prevented from downloading certain types of files, and
shall not be able to bypass security warnings.

## /description

Google Chrome allows to block certain types of downloads, and won't let
users bypass the security warnings, depending on the classification of
Safe Browsing.

## /implementations/0/description

To establish the recommended configuration via Group Policy, set the
following UI path to `Enabled` with value 'Block dangerous downloads'
selected from drop down:

`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Google\Google Chrome\Allow download restrictions`

Impact:

If this setting is enabled, all downloads are allowed, except for those
that carry Safe Browsing warnings.
