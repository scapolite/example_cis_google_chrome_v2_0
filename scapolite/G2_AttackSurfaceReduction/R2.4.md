## /rule

(L2) Ensure 'Control use of the WebUSB API' is set to 'Enabled' with
'Do not allow any site to request access to USB devices via the WebUSB
API'

## /rationale

WebUSB is opening the doors for sophisticated phishing attacks that
could bypass hardware-based two-factor authentication devices (e.g.
Yubikey devices).

## /description

Google Chrome offers a API which allows the access to connected USB
devices from the browser.

## /implementations/0/description

To establish the recommended configuration via Group Policy, set the
following UI path to `Enabled` with
`Do not allow any site to request access to USB devices via the WebUSB API`
selected from the drop down:

`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Google\Google Chrome\Content Settings\Control use of the WebUSB API`

Impact:

If this setting is enabled and set to
`Do not allow any site to request access to USB devices via the WebUSB API`,
websites can no longer access connected USB devices via the API which
could also prevent 2FA USB devices from working properly.
