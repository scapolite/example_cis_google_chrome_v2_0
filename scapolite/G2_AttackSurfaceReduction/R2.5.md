## /rule

(L1) Ensure 'Configure extension installation blacklist' is set to
'Enabled' ("\*" for all extensions)

## /rationale

This can be used to block extensions that could potentially allow remote
control of the system through the browser. If there are extensions
needed for securing the browser or for enterprise use these can be
enabled by configuring either the policy
`Configure extension installation whitelist` or the policy
`Extension management settings`.

## /description

Enabling this setting allows you to specify which extensions the users
can NOT install. Extensions already installed will be removed if
blacklisted.

NOTE: Chrome does offer a more granular permission based configuration
called `Extension management settings` if blacklisting all extensions is
too aggressive, which allows an organization to drill down to the exact
permissions that they want to lock down. The extensions management
settings requires more coordination and effort to understand what the
security requirements are to block site and device permissions globally
as well as more IT management to deploy the policy, the benefit would
allow access to more extensions to their end-users. See link in
reference section

NOTE 2: If Chrome Cleanup is Disabled, users my want to configure the
extension blacklist instead of using the Extension Management option.
Chrome Cleanup can help protect against malicious extensions when paired
with the Extension Management policy.

## /implementations/0/description

To establish the recommended configuration via Group Policy, set the
following UI path to `Enabled` with value `*` specified.

`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Google\Google Chrome\Extensions\Configure Extension Installation Blacklist`

Impact:

Any installed extension will be removed unless it is specified on the
extension whitelist, if an organization is using any approved password
managers ensure that the extension is added to the whitelist.
