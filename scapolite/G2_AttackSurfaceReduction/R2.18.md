## /rule

(L2) Ensure 'Whether online OCSP/CRL checks are required for local
trust anchors' is set to 'Enabled'

## /rationale

Certificates shall always be validated.

## /description

Google Chrome performs revocation checking for server certificates that
successfully validate and are signed by locally-installed CA
certificates. If Google Chrome is unable to obtain revocation status
information, such certificates will be treated as revoked
('hard-fail').

## /implementations/0/description

To establish the recommended configuration via Group Policy, set the
following UI path to `Enabled`:

`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Google\Google Chrome\Whether online OCSP/CRL checks are required for local trust anchors`

Impact:

A revocation check will be performed for server certificates that
successfully validate and are signed by locally-installed CA
certificates. if the OCSP server goes down, then this will hard-fail and
prevent browsing to those sites.
