## /rule

(L2) Ensure 'Default notification setting' is set to 'Enabled' with
'Do not allow any site to show desktop notifications'

## /rationale

If the website operator decides to send messages unencrypted Google's
servers may process it as plain text. Furthermore, potentially
compromised or faked notifications might trick users into clicking on a
malicious link.

## /description

Google Chrome offers websites to display desktop notifications. These
are push messages which are sent from the website operator through
Google infrastructure to Chrome.

## /implementations/0/description

To establish the recommended configuration via Group Policy, set the
following UI path to `Enabled` with
`Do not allow any site to show desktop notifications` selected from the
drop down:

`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Google\Google Chrome\Content Settings\Default notification setting`

Impact:

If this setting is enabled and set to
`Do not allow any site to show desktop notifications`, notifications
will not be displayed for any sites and the user will not be asked.
