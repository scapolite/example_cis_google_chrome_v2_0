## /rule

(L1) Ensure 'Enable firewall traversal from remote access host' is set
to 'Disabled'

## /rationale

If this setting is enabled, remote clients can discover and connect to
this machines even if they are separated by a firewall.

## /description

Chrome enables the usage of STUN servers which allows remote clients to
discover and connect to a machine even if they are separated by a
firewall. By disabling this feature, in conjunction with filtering
outgoing UDP connections, the machine will only allow connections from
machines within the local network.

## /implementations/0/description

To establish the recommended configuration via Group Policy, set the
following UI path to `Disabled`.

`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Google\Google Chrome\Configure remote access options\Enable firewall traversal from remote access host`

Impact:

If this setting is disabled and outgoing UDP connections are filtered by
the firewall, this machine will only allow connections from client
machines within the local network.
