## /rule

(L1) Ensure 'Browser sign in settings' is set to 'Enabled' with
'Disabled browser sign-in' specified

## /rationale

Since external accounts are unmanaged and potentially used to access
several private computer systems and many different websites, connecting
accounts via sign-in poses a security risk for the company. It
interferes with the corporate management mechanisms, as well as permits
an unwanted leak of corporate information and possible mixture with
private, non-company data.

## /description

Google Chrome offers to sign-in with your Google account and use account
related services like Chrome sync. It is possible to sign-in to Google
Chrome with a Google account to use services like synchronization and
can also be used for configuration and management of the browser.

NOTE: if an organization is a G Suite Enterprise customer they will want
to leave this setting enabled so that users can sign in with Google
accounts.

## /implementations/0/description

To establish the recommended configuration via Group Policy, set the
following UI path to `Enabled` with value 'Disabled browser sign-in'
selected from the drop down.

`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Google\Google Chrome\Browser sign in settings`

Impact:

If this setting is enabled the user can not sign in to the browser and
use google account based services like Chrome sync.
