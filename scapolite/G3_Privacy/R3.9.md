## /rule

(L1) Ensure 'Enable network prediction' is set to 'Enabled' with
'Do not predict actions on any network connection' selected

## /rationale

Opening connections to resources which may never be visited shall be
prevented.

## /description

Google Chrome comes with the network prediction feature which provides
DNS prefetching, TCP and SSL preconnection, and prerendering of web
pages. This feature might lead to connections to websites which the user
has not navigated to and may never visit.

## /implementations/0/description

To establish the recommended configuration via Group Policy, set the
following UI path to `Enabled` with value
`Do not predict actions on any network connection` selected from the
drop down:

`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Google\Google Chrome\Enable network prediction`

Impact:

Users will not be presented with web page predictions.
