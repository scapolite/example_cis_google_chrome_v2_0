## /rule

(L1) Ensure 'Enable Safe Browsing for trusted sources' is set to
'Disabled'

## /rationale

Information requested from trusted sources shall not be sent to
Google's safe browsing servers.

## /description

Google Chrome can be adjusted to allow download without Safe Browsing
checks when the requested files is from a trusted source. Trusted
sources can be defined using policy 'Configure the list of domains on
which Safe Browsing will not trigger warnings'.

## /implementations/0/description

To establish the recommended configuration via Group Policy, set the
following UI path to `Disabled`:

`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Google\Google Chrome\Enable Safe Browsing for trusted sources`

Impact:

If this setting is disabled files downloaded from intranet resources
will not be checked by Google Services.
