## /rule

(L1) Ensure 'Default geolocation setting' is set to 'Enabled' with
'Do not allow any site to track the users' physical location'

## /rationale

From a privacy point of view it is not desirable to submit indicators
regarding the location of the device, since the processing of this
information cannot be determined. Furthermore, this may leak information
about the network infrastructure around the device.

## /description

Google Chrome supports to track the users' physical location using GPS,
data about nearby Wi-Fi access points or cellular signal sites/towers
(even if you're not using them), and your computer's IP.

## /implementations/0/description

To establish the recommended configuration via Group Policy, set the
following UI path to `Enabled` with
`Do not allow any site to track the users' physical location` selected
from the drop down:

`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Google\Google Chrome\Content Settings\Default geolocation setting`

Impact:

If this setting is disabled, chrome will no longer send data about
nearby Wi-Fi access points or cellular signal sites/towers (even if
you're not using them), and your computer's IP address to google.
