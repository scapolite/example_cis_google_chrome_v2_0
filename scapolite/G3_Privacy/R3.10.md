## /rule

(L1) Ensure 'Enable search suggestions' is set to 'Disabled'

## /rationale

Using search suggestions may leak information as soon as it is
typed/pasted into the omnibox, e.g. passwords, internal webservices,
folder structures, etc.

## /description

Google Chrome offers suggestions in Google Chrome's omnibox while user
is typing.

## /implementations/0/description

To establish the recommended configuration via Group Policy, set the
following UI path to `Disabled`:

`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Google\Google Chrome\Enable search suggestions`

Impact:

The user has to send the search request actively by using the search
button or hitting "Enter".
