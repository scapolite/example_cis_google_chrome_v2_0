## /rule

(L1) Ensure 'Enable deleting browser and download history' is set to
'Disabled'

## /rationale

If users can delete websites they have visited or files they have
downloaded it will be easier for them to hide evidence that they have
visited unauthorized or malicious sites.

## /description

Google Chrome offer to delete the browser and download history using the
clear browsing data menu.

## /implementations/0/description

To establish the recommended configuration via Group Policy, set the
following UI path to `Disabled`:

`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Google\Google Chrome\Enable deleting browser and download history`

Impact:

If this setting is disabled, browsing and download history cannot be
deleted by using the clear browsing data menu.
