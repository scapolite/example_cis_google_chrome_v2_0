## /rule

(L1) Ensure 'Enable URL-keyed anonymized data collection' is set to
'Disabled'

## /rationale

Anonymized data collection shall be disabled, since it is unclear which
information exactly is sent to Google.

## /description

Google Chrome offers the feature URL-keyed anonymized data collection.
This sends URLs of pages the user visits to Google to optimize its
services.

## /implementations/0/description

To establish the recommended configuration via Group Policy, set the
following UI path to `Disabled`:

`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Google\Google Chrome\Enable URL-keyed anonymized data collection`

Impact:

anonymized data will not be sent to Google to help optimize its services
