## /rule

(L1) Ensure 'Block third party cookies' is set to 'Enabled'

## /rationale

Blocking third party cookies can help protect a user's privacy by
eliminating a number of website tracking cookies.

## /description

Chrome allows cookies to be set by web page elements that are not from
the domain in the user's address bar. Enabling this feature prevents
third party cookies from being set.

**NOTE**: Third Party Cookies and Tracking Protection are required for
many business critical websites, including SalesForce and Office365.

## /implementations/0/description

To establish the recommended configuration via Group Policy, set the
following UI path to `Enabled`.

`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Google\Google Chrome\Block third party cookies`

Impact:

Enabling this setting prevents cookies from being set by web page
elements that are not from the domain that is in the browser's address
bar.
