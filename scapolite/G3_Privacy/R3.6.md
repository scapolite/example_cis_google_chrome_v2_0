## /rule

(L1) Ensure 'Control how Chrome Cleanup reports data to Google' is set
to 'Disabled'

## /rationale

Anonymous crash/usage data can be used to identify people, companies and
information, which can be considered data ex-filtration from company
systems.

## /description

Chrome provides a Cleanup-feature to detect unwanted software. The
results of the cleanup may be shared with Google to assist with future
unwanted software detection. These results will contain file metadata,
automatically installed extensions and registry keys.

## /implementations/0/description

To establish the recommended configuration via Group Policy, set the
following UI path to `Disabled`:

`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Google\Google Chrome\Control how Chrome Cleanup reports data to Google`

Impact:

Chrome Cleanup detected unwanted software, will no longer report
metadata about the scan to Google.
