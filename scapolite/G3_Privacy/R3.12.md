## /rule

(L1) Ensure 'Enable alternate error pages' is set to 'Disabled'

## /rationale

Using navigation suggestions may leak information about the web site
intended to be visited.

## /description

Google Chrome offers to show suggestions for the page you were trying to
reach when it is unable to connect to a web address such as 'Page Not
Found'.

## /implementations/0/description

To establish the recommended configuration via Group Policy, set the
following UI path to `Disabled`:

`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Google\Google Chrome\Enable alternate error pages`

Impact:

If this setting is disabled, Chrome does no longer use a web service to
help resolve navigation errors.
